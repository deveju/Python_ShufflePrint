# Python_ShufflePrint
##### Simple printing while shuffling the characters.
##### I only used the *time* library to slow the printing down a bit, since it was too fast to see the effect.
##### To get the characters list I used the string library, made a *string.printable* variable and transformed it to a list using the *list()* function and deleted some characters (I think) no one will use.
